# Xls Spring Boot Starter
This project's main goal is to integrate features into springboot for exporting data in xls/xlsx format.

# Getting Started

### Use It
In order to use just add the dependency in your pom.xml.

### Xlsx Functions

About the xlsx export system you have essentially two ways of operating:

* Import an xlsx template with all the styles and formatting already set, 
then modify it by inserting the values and finally saving it.
* Create an xlsx file from scratch, populate it with values and styles and save it.
